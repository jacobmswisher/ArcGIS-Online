# Mapping with ArcGIS Online

Welcome to the curriculum page for the Mapping with ArcGIS Online workshop.

This workshop covers the foundations of mapping in ESRI's ArcGIS Online platform. ArcGIS Online is a browser-based GIS platform that allows users to create, visualize, and manipulate spatial data. Whether you are interested in working with larger datasets, collaborating on GIS-driven research projects, or creating maps to add to a class project or senior thesis, ArcGIS Online offers an excellent workspace for researchers who are beginning to work with GIS.
